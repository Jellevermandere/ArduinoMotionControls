# ArduinoMotionControls
a very barebones implementation if an Arduino connection with Unity to use motion controls
## Workings

This small project includes the basic set-up for a motion controlled game with an Arduino powered Accelerometer. The corresponding Arduino code is also written in the Unity script. \
There is also a sound controller which listens to the microphone and does something when that value goes above a certain level.
